<h4> 4.Now Run "Show Shared Drive Name" to see available Shared Drives is name in your account. Or you can Run "Show My Drive's Files Name" to get all names of files available in your My Drive.</h4>
<p><img src="Img/61.png" /></p>
<h4> 5.You can also check the Speed from which your Data will be Copied.(Optional)</h4>
<p><img src="Img/62.png" /></p>
<h4> 6.Now by using the Code as shown in the Following image you can transfer Data from One Shared Drive to Another Shared Drive, Just replace "FROM" with the Shared Drive Name from which you have to copy data and replace "TO" from the Shared Drive Name to which you have to copy data. You can copy &amp; paste the Names from step 3.</h4>
<p><img src="Img/63.png" /></p>
<h4> 7.Again! Using the code as shown in the following Image you can copy data from My Drive to Shared Drive, Just replace "FILE NAME" with File you have to copy from My Drive and replace "SHARED DRIVE NAME" with Shared Drive Name to which you have to copy data. Also if you like to copy all Data from My Drive at once then remove "FILE NAME" and directly Enter "SHARED DRIVE NAME" and hit "Play Code" Button. </h4>
<p><img src="Img/64.png" /></p>
<h4> 8.Also! You can copy data from Shared Drive to My Drive using code as shown in the Image. Just replace "SHARED DRIVE NAME" from Shared Drive name from which you have to copy data and there is no need to do any changes in the destination.</h4>
<p><img src="Img/65.png" /></p>
<h5> <b><i>❗NOTE: You can Copy Data of Max 750GB/Day because of limit set by Google! However you can use multiple accounts to bypass this limit.❗</i></b></h5>

<h2> 🤔 Why Use This?</h2>
<h4>If you use Google Collab for Long term use, then you can understand that it requires Human Interaction atleast one time per 90 Minutes! Otherwise it will cancel the task and all your Work will got failed! But this Repository comes with the code which prevent this. Yes you heard it right just click on the "Play Code Button" and then don't worry about time out! Also sometimes it become defficult to upload Files directly to Shared Drives, So we have added a dedicated Shared Drive Section in the UI.
